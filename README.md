The "Thyroid Disease Prediction" project analyzes medical data to forecast thyroid problems using machine learning and Python. The process involves using Pandas for cleaning and preprocessing a thyroid dataset, using imputation methods to handle missing data, and selecting features of interest to analyze. To classify thyroid disorders, a range of machine learning models are created, including logistic regression and decision trees, using Scikit-learn. The performance is evaluated by using descriptive statistics, model evaluation criteria including accuracy, and data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The objective of the project is to design a reliable prediction system that will help in the early diagnosis and treatment of thyroid conditions.
